# Final Project Documentation: Edge AI Smart Farm Monitor

## 1. Overview and Goals

The "Edge AI Smart Farm Monitor" aims to enhance precision farming by using an edge AI model to analyze environmental sensor data and issue real-time alerts to a Node-RED dashboard. Sensors like DHT11 and soil moisture sensors are interfaced with an STM32 microcontroller, which communicates with a Raspberry Pi acting as a gateway and AI inference engine. The goal is to reduce unnecessary irrigation, detect drought conditions, and support automated monitoring.

## 2. Build System

**Yocto Project** will be used to create a custom embedded Linux image for Raspberry Pi, including support for Python3, MQTT clients, TensorFlow Lite, and GPIO/I2C support.

---

## 3. Hardware Platform

* **Primary Gateway:** Raspberry Pi 4
* **Sensor Hub:** STM32 Bluepill
* **Sensors:** DHT11 (Temp/Humidity), Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog), optional: PIR for motion or camera

---

## 4. Open Source Tools Used

* [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite): Edge inference
* [Mosquitto MQTT](https://mosquitto.org/): Lightweight messaging
* [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/): Dashboard and alert system
* \[WiringPi / Python RPi.GPIO]

---

## 5. Previous Course Content Reused

* Device Tree customization for I2C/UART
* Yocto meta-layer design (from previous assignments)
* Basic GPIO and peripheral drivers (reused and enhanced)

---

## 6. New Topics to Explore

* AI inference using `.tflite` models
* MQTT communication to Node-RED
* OTA updates using shell scripts

---

## 7. Course-Specific Work

This project is implemented solely for this course. No overlapping assignments from other courses are reused.
